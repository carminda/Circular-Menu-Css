# CircularMenu

This is an Angular 7 project containing a very simple circular menu with 6 options. 
If you click on one of the options it will display the corresponding info + image. 
To go back to the circular menu you just need to click on any part of the maximized info section.  

Is only supported for Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge.

Implementation based on https://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/08/09/building-a-circular-navigation-with-css-transforms/
