# CircularMenu

This is an Angular 7 project containing a very simple circular menu with 6 options. 
If you click on one of the options it will display the corresponding info + image. 
To go back to the circular menu you just need to click on any part of the maximized info section.  

Implementation based on https://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/08/09/building-a-circular-navigation-with-css-transforms/
